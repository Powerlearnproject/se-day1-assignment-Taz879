Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the maintenance of high quality systems.
Importance:Enables creatione of softwares that are used in communication, entertainment, healthcare among others.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languges like Cotran
2.Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in he 1960s
3.Advent of structured programming in1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases include: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing code and buildingthe software according to the design specifications
Deployment: Releasing the software to the users
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must becompleted before moving to the next. It is rigid and changes are difficult. There is limited customer involvement until the end. Testing is done at the end. It is good for large projects with heavy documentiaton.

Agile methodology: An iterative, flexible appproach that breaks projects into small increments and continuous adjustments. It is highly adaptable, there is continuous feedback, testing can be done throughout and requires light documentation.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- Writes code and implements software solutions
Project manager- Oversees the planning, executionand delivery f software projects
Quality assurance engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- A software suite that provides a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging and testing applications. They increase productivity, simplify debugging and enhance code quality. Examples include Visual Studio code and PyCharm.
VCS- Tracks changes in code, allowing developers to collaborate efficiently maintain version hisstory and revert to previous versions if needed. It facilitates collaboration between multiple developers, maintains code history, enhances code stability and continuous integration. Examples include Git, Subversion, Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements-Have clear communication, Use agile development methodoligies to adapt to changes as they occur. 
Tight deadlines- Proper time management- one can implement time management tools, automation of tasks can be done
Technical debt- Avoid rushing, do automated testing, and encourage peer code reviews.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing individual components or modules of software 
Integration testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets needs 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of crafting questions to get the best possible responses from AI models. It simportant as it enhances AI performance, improves productivity and reduces bias That may occur by producing balanced fact based responses.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- 'Best football clubs'
Improved prompt- 'What are the most successful football clubs in European football'
The second prompt specifies the georaphical location of the clubs as well as the competitions that would be used to rank the football clubs. Therefore, one would get better results.
